  <h1>Page Title: Exploring Web Accessibility</h1> 

  <main> 

    <h2>Understanding WCAG Principles</h2> 

    <p>The principles of web accessibility are commonly summarized by the acronym POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Perceivable means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented, whether through text, images, or sounds, and alternative formats should be available when necessary. Operable refers to the need for user interface components and navigation to be operable, meaning users must be able to interact with and control them via multiple input methods, such as keyboard and mouse. Understandable content ensures that users can comprehend the information and operation of the user interface, while a robust website supports compatibility with various assistive technologies and future advancements, ensuring consistent functionality across different user tools and software....</p> 

    <h3>Perceivable</h3> 

    <p>The perceivable principle in web accessibility ensures that all information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can sense. This involves providing text alternatives for non-text content, such as images and multimedia, so that all users, including those with visual impairments, can access the content. It also includes creating content that can be easily adapted into multiple formats, such as large print, braille, or audio, without losing meaning. Additionally, perceivable content must offer enough contrast between text and background colors, making it readable to users with low vision or color blindness....</p> 

    <h3>Operable</h3> 

    <p>The operable principle ensures that web interfaces and navigation must be usable and accessible through various means of interaction. This means that all functionalities should be available via keyboard, allowing users who cannot use a mouse to navigate and use the site. It also requires that webpages provide users enough time to read and use content, accommodating those who might need more time due to mobility or cognitive disabilities. Operable interfaces must not include elements that can cause seizures, like flashing lights, and should provide ways to help users navigate, such as using headings and labels clearly.</p> 

    <h2>Practical Tips for Accessible Design</h2> 

    <p>Content offering actionable advice is critical for ensuring that information is practical and easily implemented by the audience. This involves clearly stating the steps necessary to accomplish a task or resolve an issue, providing users with clear, concise, and direct guidance. Such advice should be structured logically, breaking down complex processes into manageable stages to enhance comprehension and execution. Additionally, incorporating examples or scenarios can make the advice more relatable and easier to apply in real-world situations.</p> 

    <h3>Use Semantic HTML</h3> 

    <p>Semantic HTML provides significant benefits by enhancing accessibility and maintaining a clear structure within web content. By using elements that clearly describe their meaning and role within a webpage, such as header, article, and footer, developers can create content that is more understandable to assistive technologies. This improved structure allows screen readers to interpret the content more accurately, improving navigation for users with disabilities. Additionally, semantic HTML contributes to a more organized codebase, making maintenance and updates easier for developers.</p>
