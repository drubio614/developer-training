    <h1>Page Title: Common Baking Mistakes</h1>

    <main>
        <h2>Mistake 1: Incorrect Measurements</h2>
        <p>Accurate measurements are crucial in baking, as even small errors can significantly impact the final result. For instance, using too much flour by not leveling off the measuring cup can lead to dry, crumbly baked goods. Similarly, misjudging the amount of baking powder or baking soda can cause cakes to either rise too much and collapse or not rise sufficiently, resulting in dense textures. To prevent these issues, bakers should always use precise measuring tools and techniques, such as weighing ingredients with a scale and using spoons and cups designed for dry or liquid ingredients as appropriate. Avoiding these common measurement errors ensures consistent and successful baking outcomes.</p>

        <h3>Problem: Sub-point on Flour</h3>
        <p>Measuring flour incorrectly can lead to significant baking mishaps. If too much flour is packed into the measuring cup, it results in dense and dry baked goods, as the excess flour throws off the moisture balance. Conversely, using too little flour may cause the dough to be too wet and sticky, leading to flat and undercooked results. To ensure accuracy, it's best to spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a straight edge, or use a kitchen scale for precise measurements.</p>
